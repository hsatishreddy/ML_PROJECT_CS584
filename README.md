### CYBERSECURITY THREAT DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORKS 

In today's digital landscape, cyber threats, including impersonation attacks, pose significant challenges to system security. Impersonation attacks involve malicious actors posing as legitimate entities to deceive and gain unauthorized access. 
Machine learning integration in cybersecurity offers improved threat detection by analyzing data patterns, enabling organizations to proactively identify and mitigate these attacks with greater accuracy and efficiency than traditional methods.

##### THE WORK INCLUDES:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** </br>
    A. Feature Generation: A Variational Autoencoder is used to generate 20 additional features to add to the data set. </br>
    B. Feature Selection: Filter methods are used to select the best features, generated features are included. </br>

2. **Building Machine Learning Models.** </br>
    A. **Logistic Regression:** Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where it models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables using a logistic function. </br>
    B. **Naïve Bayes:** Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label. It calculates the probability of a data point belonging to each class and selects the class with the highest probability. </br>
    C. **Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVC):** Linear Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between them. </br>
    D. **K-Nearest Neighbors:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm where a data point's classification or regression is determined by the majority vote or average of its 'k' nearest neighbors in the feature space, making it a simple yet effective method for pattern recognition and prediction tasks. </br>
    E. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA ):** Linear Discriminant Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique and a classification algorithm. It finds linear combinations of features that best separate multiple classes by maximizing the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance. </br>
   
    
3. **Tuning the models.** </br>
    Model tuning involves adjusting the hyperparameters of the algorithms to optimize their performance. </br>
    Hyperparameters are parameters that are not directly learned during training but affect the behavior of the model. </br>
    Tuning the models is essential to ensure they generalize well to unseen data and achieve the desired level of accuracy. </br>
    
   **Method Used for Tuning:** </br>
    Random search: Randomly samples hyperparameters from predefined distributions to find a good solution more efficiently.
