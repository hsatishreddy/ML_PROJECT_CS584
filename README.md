CYBERSECURITY THREAT DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORKS
In today's digital landscape, cyber threats, including impersonation attacks, pose significant challenges to system security. Impersonation attacks involve malicious actors posing as legitimate entities to deceive and gain unauthorized access. 
Machine learning integration in cybersecurity offers improved threat detection by analyzing data patterns, enabling organizations to proactively identify and mitigate these attacks with greater accuracy and efficiency than traditional methods.

THE WORK INCLUDES:

1. Data Preprocessing:
    A. Feature Generation
    B. Feature Selection
2. Building Machine Learning Models. 
3. Model Performance Comparison.
4. Tuning the models.
